    <p>Hey y'all. As you can see, my name is Jared Tart. I currently live in the middle of nowhere Missouri. There's not much to do out here unfortunatly.</p>
    <p>I'm a junior on the software development track. I hope to get a job as a software developer for a mid size 
        company in a year when I graduate. I personally don't care for web design though I have a feeling that I will end up needing to use it someday.</p>
    <p>In what little free time I have I am a huge nerd. I love anything and everything Sci-Fi/Fantasy. That will include books, movies, TV shows, video/card/board games, 
        and table top role playing games (like D&D).</p>
